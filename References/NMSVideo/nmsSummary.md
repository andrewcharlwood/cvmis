## 01: Introduction and Purpose [00:00:00]

The **New Medicine Service (NMS)** is a professional consultation service provided by pharmacies for patients starting a new medication for specific long-term conditions.

* **Primary Aim:** To support patients in the initial weeks of treatment to ensure they take medication safely and effectively.
* **The "Why":** * **Patient Health:** Improves quality of life and treatment outcomes.
    * **NHS Efficiency:** Reduces medicine wastage and prevents hospital admissions due to non-adherence.
    * **Financial Impact:** Creates measurable savings for the healthcare system.

## 02: The Three-Stage Workflow [00:00:36]

### Stage 1: Engagement (Day 0)
* **Trigger:** When a patient presents a prescription for a new eligible medication.
* **Process:**
    * Identify eligibility based on condition.
    * Explain the service and benefits.
    * **Consent:** Obtain formal written consent.
    * **Contact:** Agree on a follow-up method (Telephone or In-Person).
* **Staff Role:** This stage can be initiated by *any* member of the pharmacy team.

### Stage 2: Intervention (Weeks 1–2)
* **Timeline:** 7 to 14 days after the patient starts the medicine.
* **Process:**
    * Pharmacist discusses how the patient is getting on.
    * Identify **barriers** (side effects, forgetfulness, or poor technique).
    * Pharmacist provides clinical advice or refers back to the GP if serious issues arise.

### Stage 3: Follow-Up (Weeks 3–4)
* **Timeline:** 2 to 3 weeks after the Intervention stage.
* **Process:**
    * Review any prior issues identified in Stage 2.
    * Reinforce the long-term benefits of the medication.
    * Confirm the patient is now taking the medicine as prescribed.

## 03: Operational Implementation [00:01:41]

### Identifying Candidates
* **The Golden Question:** *"Are any of these medications new for you?"*
* **The Visual Cue:** Draw a small **star** on the right-hand side of the drug name on the prescription. This alerts the pharmacist that an NMS opportunity exists.

### Eligibility Criteria (Target Conditions) [00:02:01]
The service is limited to patients with:
1.  **Asthma and COPD:** Respiratory issues (e.g., new inhalers).
2.  **Hypertension:** High blood pressure.
3.  **Antiplatelets/Anticoagulation:** Blood thinning medications.
4.  **Type 2 Diabetes:** Blood sugar management.

### The Paperwork [00:02:35]
* **Consent Form:** Must be signed and dated by the patient.
* **Phone Number:** Essential to capture an accurate number for the follow-up call.
* **Dispensary Workflow:** If labeling a prescription for an absent patient, check records. If it looks like a new NMS drug, "star" the script and add a consent form to the basket for the pharmacist to handle during the handout.

## 05: Summary and Key Takeaways

### High-Level Summary
The NMS is a structured pharmacy intervention designed to catch medication errors and adherence issues early. By utilizing a three-step process—Engagement, Intervention, and Follow-up—pharmacies can halve the rate of patient non-adherence for critical conditions like diabetes and hypertension.

### Key Insights
* **Team Effort:** Identification isn't just for pharmacists; counter staff and dispensers are the "front line."
* **Early Intervention:** Most problems occur in the first 2 weeks of treatment.
* **Clinical Safety:** Provides a safety net to refer patients back to GPs before health deteriorates.
* **Statistics:** NMS reduces non-adherence from 20% down to 10% by the final stage.
* **Patient Care:** The service exists because "we care" about patient outcomes, not just dispensing boxes.

### Glossary of Terms
* **Adherence:** Taking medications exactly as prescribed (timing, dose, technique).
* **COPD:** Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (lung condition).
* **GP:** General Practitioner (Primary Care Doctor).
* **Hypertension:** High Blood Pressure.
* **Intervention:** A discussion to identify and solve a healthcare problem.
