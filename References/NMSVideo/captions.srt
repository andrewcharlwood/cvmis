00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,899
Hi i'm Andy I'm one of the Pharmacists at
the Great Yarmouth Store, I'm here to talk

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:06,190
to you a little bit about NMS, the new medicine
service, we're going to be going over all

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,900
parts of the service and what you can do to
help us.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,679
The new medicine service, NMS, is a service
we provide for patients starting a new medication

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,710
for one of the conditions listed on your screen
now.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,730
People often have problems when they start
a new medication, NMS allows us to support

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,160
those patients with any problems they may
face in those initial weeks.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,090
Our aim is to help patients take their medication
safely and more effectively.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,680
This in turn results in savings for the NHS,
whilst improving our patients quality of life.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,710
The service is made of three main stages,

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,100
Initially you have the engagement stage, which
is when we speak to the patient before they

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,670
start taking their medication
We’ll see if they’re eligible for NMS

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,530
and ask if they’re interested in the service.

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,040
We’ll obtain their written consent, and
agree on the best way we can contact them.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,210
This can be on the phone or in person.

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,649
The intervention stage is 1-2 weeks after
starting the new medication.

17
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,239
The pharmacist will speak with the patient
about how they take their medcine, and identify

18
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,310
any barriers which prevent them from taking
it.

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,000
This is where the pharmacist can give advice
to the patient, and if anything serious has

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,909
come up, they can be referred to the GP.

21
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:09,000
Now if they’re going to continue with the
medication, they'll agree a time for the follow

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,320
up stage.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,100
The follow up stage is 2-3 weeks after the
intervention stage.

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,970
It’s a similar conversation to the intervention
stage, but the pharmacist will follow up anything

25
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,900
any prior issues
They’ll reinforce the benefits of the medicine,

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,310
and ensure it’s being taken as prescribed.

27
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,010
Again, at any point if any issues that arisen
since the intervention, they can still be

28
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,619
referred to the GP.

29
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,159
The engagement stage is where you can really
help us.

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,520
Identifying and signing patients up for NMS
can be undertaken by anyone in the pharmacy.

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,510
Every time you sign a patient up for NMS,
you give them the best possible chance of

32
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,830
getting the most benefit from that medicine.

33
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,130
To help demonstrate this we’ll be following
Rob.

34
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,350
He’s been prescribed a new inhaler for his
asthma.

35
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,470
So when rob hands in a prescription, we’ll
ask him one simple question

36
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,869
“Are any of these medications new for you?”

37
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:54,479
In this case, Rob has a new inhaler, so we’ll
place a small star to the right hand side

38
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,540
of the new drug.

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,369
This highlights to the pharmacist what medicines
are new.

40
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:02,960
To give you a better idea of what medication
is eligible for NMS, let’s go to the dispensary.

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,090
So here's some medication you might see under
NMS.

42
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,869
So you're looking for inhalers, that's for
Asthma or COPD

43
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,090
Got your blood pressure medication there,
your antiplatelet or anticoagulation medication

44
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,450
And finally, medication used for type two
diabetes

45
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,040
Doesn't matter if you don't know all the medication
under NMS, but it's great if you know some

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,200
Rob’s been prescribed a new salbutamol inhaler,
this medication is eligible for NMS, so we’ll

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,880
check if he’s using it for a target condition
Are you using this for Asthma?

48
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Yes, I am,

49
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,020
So after confirming the medication is for
a target condition, and it’s within NMS,

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,050
you can sign them up!

51
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,569
Now ensure you explain the consent form to
the patient, speak to your pharmacy manager

52
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:44,310
for a more detailed explanation of this.

53
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:51,379
If they’re happy to continue, ensure they
sign and date the form, then confirm their

54
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,240
phone number, or agree on a good time to come
into the pharmacy.

55
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,850
But what if you haven’t seen the patient?

56
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,550
If you’re labelling their medication, a
quick glance at their records may indicate

57
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,550
if it’s new.

58
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,800
If you think it is, star the medication on
the prescription and add a consent form to

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,840
the basket if you think it might be an NMS.

60
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,910
When the pharmacist hands out the medication,
they will be able to confirm if the patient

61
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,830
is eligible to take part in the new medicines
service.

62
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,380
Rob has not had this inhaler before so the
pharmacist will discuss things with him like

63
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,019
the benefits and side effects

64
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,330
And In one to two weeks’ time, we’ill
give him a call, and see how he is getting

65
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,330
along.

66
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,590
Something as simple as a phone call could
make a huge difference to someone’s health.

67
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,690
Rob’s asthma is under far better control
thanks to NMS, turns out he wasn’t using

68
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,790
the inhaler as intended.

69
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,550
Thanks to the new medicine service, he is
making far greater gains from his medication.

70
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,209
But Rob’s not alone, data shows that nearly
1 in 5 patients aren’t taking their medication

71
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,750
as prescribed at the intervention stage.

72
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,890
Thanks to the new medicine service, by the
follow up stage 2-3 weeks later, this number

73
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,570
reduces to nearly 1 in 10.

74
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,050
We want to be able to support as many patients
like Rob as we can, as they start their own

75
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,060
journey with a new medicine.

76
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,060
That’s why we need your help.

77
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,799
Every patient we identify and sign up for
NMS, is a step towards ensuring our patients

78
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,600
are receiving the best healthcare possible.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,090
We do it because we care.

80
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,799
And It all starts by asking one simple question.
