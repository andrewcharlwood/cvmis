The current layout is still tied to an older navbar/subnav model and shows incorrect scroll behavior in the sidebar area.\n\n## Context\n\nCurrent implementation has separate top navigation (`TopBar`, `SubNav`) and a desktop-only sidebar. On upward scrolling in the sidebar, hidden space becomes visible in a way that implies layered layout offsets from the old top navbar/subnav structure.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Remove top navbar/subnav from the rendered dashboard flow and migrate section navigation into the sidebar.\n- Replace section labels with recruiter-facing content labels (no GP/internal metaphors as labels):\n  - Overview\n  - Projects\n  - Experience\n  - Education\n  - Skills\n- Keep iconography that can still evoke the GP-system metaphor, but labels must match actual portfolio content.\n- Add a `Navigation` subheader area in the sidebar for section links.\n- Keep a separate `My Data` area above `Navigation` in expanded sidebar mode.\n- Ensure the sidebar no longer reveals hidden spacing/artifacts when scrolling upward.\n- Implement mobile sidebar behavior (currently missing):\n  - Sidebar is collapsed by default.\n  - A hamburger control appears at the top and toggles expanded/collapsed state.\n  - In collapsed mode, render a compact vertical rail with:\n    - hamburger control at the top\n    - the five section icons directly beneath for one-tap section jumping\n  - In expanded mode, reveal full sidebar content:\n    - `My Data` block\n    - `Navigation` links with icon + text labels\n    - tags, alerts, and highlights sections\n- Preserve or improve accessibility:\n  - Keyboard operable controls\n  - Correct `aria-*` labels for menu toggle and navigation regions\n  - Visible focus states\n- Preserve smooth section scrolling/anchor behavior from navigation actions.\n\n## Suggested GP-Metaphor Icon Mapping (labels remain recruiter-facing)\n\nUse these concrete icon targets (or closest equivalents from existing icon library):\n\n- Overview: `UserRound` (profile summary)\n- Projects: `Pill` (interventions/medications metaphor)\n- Experience: `Workflow` (pathway/Sankey metaphor)\n- Education: `GraduationCap` (training/education)\n- Skills: `Wrench` (capabilities/tools)\n\nLabel text must stay recruiter-facing:\n- `Overview`, `Projects`, `Experience`, `Education`, `Skills`\n\n## Likely Files In Scope\n\n- `src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`\n- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`\n- `src/components/SubNav.tsx`\n- `src/components/TopBar.tsx`\n- `src/index.css`\n- Any related hooks/types/styles needed for section activity and responsive state\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nAll of the following must be true:\n\n- [ ] No top navbar/subnav is rendered in the final dashboard layout.\n- [ ] Sidebar contains the five required recruiter-facing nav labels under a `Navigation` subheader.\n- [ ] Expanded sidebar includes a distinct `My Data` area above `Navigation`.\n- [ ] Sidebar scrolling no longer exposes hidden top spacing/artifacts when scrolling upward.\n- [ ] Desktop navigation from sidebar correctly jumps/scrolls to each section.\n- [ ] On mobile, sidebar is collapsed by default with hamburger at top and five icon shortcuts visible.\n- [ ] On mobile expand, sidebar shows `My Data`, full navigation links (icon + text), and tags/alerts/highlights.\n- [ ] Navigation controls are keyboard accessible with appropriate ARIA semantics.\n- [ ] `npm run lint` passes.\n- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes.\n- [ ] `npm run build` passes.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Use the existing project stack and conventions (TypeScript + React + current design language).\n- Do not reintroduce GP-style labels like \"Significant Interventions\" or \"Patient Summary\" for the sidebar nav text.\n- Keep changes focused on layout/navigation behavior; avoid unrelated refactors.\n\n## Status\n\nTrack implementation progress in this file or `.ralph/plan.md`.\nWhen all success criteria are met, print LOOP_COMPLETE.\n"}}
