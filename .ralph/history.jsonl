maintaining the PMR design language:\n\n**Links:**\n- [ ] Strength-weighted stroke width at rest: `0.5 + strength * 1.5` (range 0.5–2px)\n- [ ] Domain-colored at rest (very low opacity: `0.08 + strength * 0.12`)\n- [ ] Improved bezier curves: offset control point by vertical distance (`cx = (sx+tx)/2 + (ty-sy)*0.15`)\n- [ ] On highlight: width `1 + strength * 2`, domain color at higher

fill-opacity 0.25, stroke-width 2, shadow-md filter\n\n**Entry animation (mount, replaced by over-time animation in Phase 3):**\n- [ ] Timeline guides fade in (200ms)\n- [ ] Role nodes slide in from

appear as nodes on the timeline (use `type: 'role'` with education styling, or add `type: 'education'`)\n- [ ] Update `src/types/pmr.ts` if new node types are needed\n- [ ] Timeline order (oldest

architecture:**\n- [ ] Create `useTimelineAnimation` hook in `src/hooks/`\n- [ ] All nodes present in simulation from start but hidden (opacity: 0) — stable positions, no layout jitter\n- [ ] Reveal chronologically: each role/education entity appears, then its skills animate in\n- [ ] Skills already visible from earlier roles just get new links (reinforcement pulse: scale 1.3x → 1.0x over 350ms)\n- [ ] Uses requestAnimationFrame + timestamp scheduler (not setTimeout chains)\n- [ ] Animation state machine in refs: IDLE → PLAYING → PAUSED → HOLDING → RESETTING → loop back to PLAYING\n- [ ] Auto-plays on load (after force simulation settles)\n- [ ] Loops continuously: hold 3s at end → fade all 400ms → pause 200ms → restart\n\n**Visual effects during reveal:**\n- [ ] Role/education

Highlight only operates on revealed nodes — unrevealed nodes stay at opacity 0\n- [ ] Multiplicative opacity: animation visibility (0 or target) × highlight emphasis (1.0 or 0.15)\n- [ ] Resume animation 800ms after last interaction ends (mouseout / background tap)\n- [ ] Explicit pause via button stays paused until user clicks play again\n- [ ] Play/pause toggle button (bottom-right of SVG area, subtle styling, larger touch target on mobile)\n- [ ] Mobile accordion works during paused state\n- [ ] Keyboard navigation works during paused state\n- [ ] Click → detail panel works during paused state\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nAll of the following must be true for LOOP_COMPLETE:\n\n- [ ] `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build` passes with zero errors\n- [ ] CareerConstellation orchestrator is < 300 lines\n- [ ] Education entities (A-Levels, MPharm) appear in the constellation\n- [ ] Animation auto-plays on load and loops continuously\n- [ ] Network builds chronologically from 2009 through to present\n- [ ] Skills accumulate visually — existing skills get new links, not duplicated\n- [ ] Hover/tap pauses animation and shows highlight on visible nodes\n- [ ] Animation resumes after 800ms of no interaction\n- [ ] Play/pause button visible and functional\n- [ ] Existing interactions preserved: click → detail panel, keyboard nav, mobile accordion\n- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` shows final state immediately with no animation\n- [ ] Links show domain colors and strength-weighted width at rest\n- [ ] No TypeScript `any` types introduced\n- [ ] No dead code or commented-out blocks\n\n## Constraints\n\n- TypeScript strict mode (`noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`)\n- Path alias: `@/*` → `src/*`\n- Styling: Tailwind utilities + CSS custom properties for design tokens\n- D3 v6 (already installed)\n- Framer Motion for non-D3 animations; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- Design tokens: Primary teal #00897B, Accent coral #FF6B6B, PMR greens/teals/greys\n- Font tokens: `--font-ui` (Elvaro), `--font-geist-mono` (monospace), `--font-primary` / `--font-secondary`\n- No automated tests — quality gates are lint + typecheck + build\n- D3 patterns: reference `.claude/skills/d3-visualization/` for force layout examples\n\n## Key Architecture Decisions\n\n1. **\"All nodes hidden\" for animation** — every node participates in the force simulation from the start (positions are stable). Reveal via opacity transitions only. Do NOT dynamically add/remove nodes from the simulation.\n\n2. **Ref-based animation state** — the animation state machine lives in refs (not React state) to avoid re-renders in the rAF loop. Only sync to React state for UI controls (play/pause button).\n\n3. **Multiplicative opacity model** — animation controls visibility (0 or target), highlight controls emphasis (1.0 or 0.15). Final opacity = animation × highlight. This prevents the two systems from conflicting.\n\n4. **Imperative D3 + React hybrid** — D3 manages SVG rendering and force simulation imperatively via refs. React manages keyboard overlay buttons and UI controls. Follow the existing pattern in the codebase.\n\n## Status\n\nTrack progress here. Mark items complete as you go.\nWhen ALL success criteria are met, print LOOP_COMPLETE.\n"}}

participates in the force simulation from the start (positions are stable). Reveal via opacity transitions only. Do NOT dynamically add/remove nodes from the simulation.\n\n2. **Ref-based animation state** — the animation state machine lives in refs (not React state) to avoid re-renders in the rAF loop. Only sync to React state for UI controls (play/pause button).\n\n3. **Multiplicative opacity model** — animation controls visibility (0 or target), highlight controls emphasis (1.0 or 0.15). Final opacity = animation × highlight. This prevents the two systems from conflicting.\n\n4. **Imperative D3 + React hybrid** — D3 manages SVG rendering and force simulation imperatively via refs. React manages keyboard overlay buttons and UI controls. Follow the existing pattern in the codebase.\n\n## Status\n\nTrack progress here.

Reduce link opacity (`src/components/constellation/constants.ts`)\n- Lower `LINK_BASE_OPACITY` from `0.08` → `0.04`\n- Lower `LINK_STRENGTH_OPACITY_FACTOR` from `0.12` → `0.06`\n- Makes skill connection lines subtler so job pills are visually clearer\n\n### 2. White background on hovered job pill (`src/hooks/useConstellationHighlight.ts`)\n- When a role/education node is the `activeNodeId`, override its `.node-circle` fill to `#FFFFFF` with `fill-opacity: 1`\n- Currently uses a gradient fill with `fill-opacity: 0.25` — make it solid white, fully opaque\n\n### 3. Move legend to top of chart + increase font size (`src/components/constellation/ConstellationLegend.tsx`)\n- Position legend as absolutely-positioned overlay at the **top** of the chart container (not below the SVG)\n- Increase font size from `10px` to `12px` to match work node label text size\n- Separate the \"Hover to explore connections\" text from the legend — see item 12\n\n### 4. Move year labels to right side of chart (`src/hooks/useForceSimulation.ts`)\n- Keep the current node layout unchanged (roles, skills, timeline line stay where they are)\n- Move year label text elements to the right edge of the chart: position at `width - sidePadding`, `text-anchor: 'end'`\n\n### 5. Change chart fonts to dashboard style (`src/hooks/useForceSimulation.ts`)\n- Year labels: change `font-family` from `var(--font-geist-mono)` to `var(--font-ui)`\n- Year indicator (animation): same font change\n\n### 6. Reverse pathway column split to 40/60 (`src/index.css`)\n- Change `.pathway-columns` grid from `minmax(0, 1.3fr) minmax(0, 1fr)` to `minmax(0, 2fr) minmax(0, 3fr)`\n- This gives 40% to work experience text and 60% to the graph\n\n### 7. Sidebar: collapses to icon rail when patient summary scrolls out of view (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx` + `src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`)\n- Sidebar already starts expanded on desktop — no change needed there\n- Add IntersectionObserver on the PatientSummaryTile element in DashboardLayout\n- When PatientSummaryTile scrolls out of view, pass a `forceCollapsed` prop to Sidebar\n- Sidebar collapses to icon rail (same as current mobile rail behaviour with nav buttons + hamburger menu)\n- When PatientSummaryTile scrolls back into view, re-expand the sidebar\n- Only applies on desktop (≥1024px) — mobile behaviour unchanged\n\n### 8. Change pathway stacking breakpoint from 1024px to 768px (`src/index.css`)\n- The `.pathway-columns` two-column layout currently triggers at `min-width: 1024px`\n- Change this to `min-width: 768px` so the graph sits beside text on tablets too\n- Sidebar breakpoint remains at 1024px (this only affects pathway columns)\n- Also update `.pathway-graph-sticky` responsive rule to match the `768px` breakpoint\n\n### 9. Repeat medications: 3-column layout (`src/components/RepeatMedicationsSubsection.tsx`)\n- Render all 3 category sections (Technical, Healthcare Domain, Strategic & Leadership) side-by-side\n- Use CSS grid: `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)` on `md` (768px+) screens\n- Stack vertically on mobile (<768px)\n- Remove the `marginTop` between categories when in grid mode (they'll be in columns)\n\n### 10. Skills hover → chart highlight (verify only)\n- `RepeatMedicationsSubsection` already calls `onNodeHighlight` on hover\n- This flows through `DashboardLayout` → `highlightedNodeId` → `CareerConstellation` → `useConstellationHighlight`\n- Verify this interaction works end-to-end. If it does, no code change needed.\n\n### 11. Play/pause button: left edge of chart, visible only when chart is in view (`src/components/constellation/PlayPauseButton.tsx` + `src/components/constellation/CareerConstellation.tsx`)\n- Move button to the far-left edge of the chart container (not bottom-right)\n- Use IntersectionObserver on the chart container to track if chart is visible\n- When chart is in viewport: show button at left edge, vertically centered\n- When chart scrolls out of view: hide the button\n- Increase base opacity from 0.6 to 0.85\n- Add slightly stronger border and subtle box-shadow for visibility\n\n### 12. \"Hover to explore connections\" text — more visible, top-left above year indicator (`src/components/constellation/ConstellationLegend.tsx` or `src/components/constellation/CareerConstellation.tsx`)\n- Separate this text from the legend dot items\n- Position at the top-left of the chart, above the year indicator text\n- Increase opacity from 0.7 to 1\n- Increase font size (match or approach the legend font size)\n- On touch devices, show \"Tap to explore connections\" instead\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nAll of the following must be true:\n- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with zero errors\n- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes with zero errors\n- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully\n- [ ] Link opacity constants lowered (LINK_BASE_OPACITY=0.04, LINK_STRENGTH_OPACITY_FACTOR=0.06)\n- [ ] Hovered role/education node gets white fill (#FFFFFF, fill-opacity 1)\n- [ ] Legend positioned at top of chart with 12px font size\n- [ ] Year labels positioned at right edge of chart with `var(--font-ui)` font\n- [ ] Pathway columns use 40/60 split (2fr/3fr)\n- [ ] Sidebar collapses to icon rail when patient summary scrolls out of view (desktop only)\n- [ ] Pathway columns go side-by-side at 768px (not 1024px)\n- [ ] Repeat medications renders 3 categories in grid columns on md+ screens\n- [ ] Play/pause button on left edge of chart, hidden when chart not in view\n- [ ] \"Hover to explore\" text at top-left of chart, full opacity, larger font\n\n## Constraints\n\n- TypeScript strict mode — `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters` enforced\n- Path alias: `@/*` → `src/*`\n- Styling: Tailwind utility classes + inline `CSSProperties` for dynamic/theme values\n- Animations: Framer Motion; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- Design tokens: Primary teal `#00897B`, Accent coral `#FF6B6B`\n- Font tokens: `--font-ui` (Elvaro Grotesque), `--font-geist-mono` (Geist Mono)\n- Do not break existing hover/click/keyboard interactions on the constellation\n- Do not alter the D3 force simulation physics or node positioning logic (except year labels)\n- Preserve existing mobile behaviour unless explicitly changed (items 8, 9)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. `src/components/constellation/constants.ts`\n2. `src/hooks/useConstellationHighlight.ts`\n3. `src/components/constellation/ConstellationLegend.tsx`\n4. `src/hooks/useForceSimulation.ts`\n5. `src/index.css`\n6. `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`\n7. `src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx`\n8. `src/components/RepeatMedicationsSubsection.tsx`\n9. `src/components/constellation/PlayPauseButton.tsx`\n10. `src/components/constellation/CareerConstellation.tsx`\n\n## Status\n\nTrack progress here.
