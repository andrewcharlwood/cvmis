## Manual Intervention -- 2026-02-16
### Reason: Sidebar navigation architecture needs a structural reset to remove navbar artifacts and align labels with recruiter-facing content.
### Changes made:
- Added `Ralph/prompts.md` with a comprehensive sidebar-first implementation prompt.
- Captured mobile collapsed sidebar requirements (hamburger + five quick-access icons).
- Captured IA/naming migration from legacy labels to content-true labels.
### Tasks reset: none
### Tasks added:
- Remove top navbar and eliminate hidden top scroll space artifact.
- Move primary nav into sidebar with canonical labels.
- Add `Navigation` subgroup and contextual links.
- Implement collapsed-by-default mobile sidebar with quick icons and expandable full menu.
- Apply GP-style iconography to recruiter-friendly labels.
### Context for next iteration:
- Treat this as a structural layout update, not a cosmetic tweak.
- Prioritize fixing offset/height logic that currently reveals hidden space above sidebar content.
- Keep text labels aligned to portfolio content while allowing metaphor-based icons.
### New guardrails added: none
