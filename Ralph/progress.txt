# Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns

### Project Structure
- Components in `src/components/`, views in `src/components/views/`
- Data files in `src/data/` — consultations.ts, medications.ts, problems.ts, investigations.ts, documents.ts, patient.ts
- Types in `src/types/pmr.ts` (PMR interfaces) and `src/types/index.ts` (Phase type)
- Hooks in `src/hooks/` — useScrollCondensation.ts, useBreakpoint.ts
- Contexts in `src/contexts/` — AccessibilityContext.tsx
- Path alias: `@/` maps to `./src/`

### Phase Management
- App.tsx controls phase: 'boot' -> 'ecg' -> 'login' -> 'pmr'
- BootSequence.tsx handles terminal animation
- ECGAnimation.tsx handles heartbeat + letter tracing + flatline exit
- LoginScreen.tsx bridges to PMRInterface.tsx

### Data Architecture (CORRECT — do not modify)
- All data files are populated with accurate CV content from References/CV_v4.md
- 5 consultation entries (roles), 18 medications (skills), 11 problems (achievements), 6 investigations (projects), 5 documents (education)
- Types are properly defined in pmr.ts — Consultation, Medication, Problem, Investigation, Document, Patient, ViewId

### Design System Requirements (from ref-design-system.md)
- Light-mode ONLY — no dark mode
- NHS blue: #005EB8 (primary interactive)
- Border radius: 4px for cards/inputs
- Borders: 1px solid #E5E7EB on tables and cards, combined with multi-layered shadows for depth
- Card shadows: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.03)
- Table row height: 40px, card padding: 16-24px, main content padding: 24px
- Fonts: [UI font] (Elvaro Grotesque or Blumir from Fonts/ dir), Geist Mono (coded entries, timestamps, data values)
- Base spacing unit: 4px — generous but structured, more whitespace than real clinical systems

### Known Dependencies
- React 18.3.1, TypeScript, Vite
- Tailwind CSS for utility classes
- Framer Motion 11.15.0 for animations
- Lucide React 0.468.0 for icons
- fuse.js will need to be installed for Task 12

### Sidebar Label Convention (IMPORTANT)
- Sidebar uses CV-friendly labels, NOT clinical jargon
- Summary (same), Experience (not Consultations), Skills (not Medications), Achievements (not Problems), Projects (not Investigations), Education (not Documents), Contact (not Referrals)
- The clinical metaphor is in the VIEW LAYOUT, not the navigation labels
- Each view should look like its clinical equivalent but the nav label tells the user what CV section they're looking at

### Visual Review (Playwright MCP)
- Dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` throughout the loop
- Use Playwright MCP tools (`mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`, `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot`, `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot`) to verify visual output
- App has boot→ECG→login→PMR sequence (~15s on first load). Use `mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for` with `time: 15` before screenshotting.
- Once in PMR phase, navigate views via hash routes: `#summary`, `#experience`, `#skills`, `#achievements`, `#projects`, `#education`, `#contact`
- If browser tools fail, skip visual review and note in iteration log — don't block progress

### Critical Styling Notes
- Design direction is **Clinical Luxury** — clinical structure, premium execution
- Premium UI font loaded from Fonts/ directory (Elvaro Grotesque or Blumir, NOT Inter/Roboto)
- Geist Mono for coded entries and timestamps (NOT Fira Code)
- Multi-layered shadows on cards — NOT flat/borderless
- Clinical alert uses spring animation (Framer Motion type: "spring"), not ease-out
- View switching INSTANT — no crossfade, no slide between views
- Login typing: 80ms/char username, 60ms/dot password. Button is USER-INTERACTIVE (not auto-triggered)
- Consultation expand/collapse: height animation ONLY, no opacity fade on content

## Iteration Log

### Iteration 1 — Task 1: Design system foundation and font setup
**Completed:** Task 1
**Changes made:**
- Added Geist Mono font to Google Fonts import in index.html (replacing reliance on Fira Code for PMR components)
- Extended Tailwind config PMR color tokens: added card, text-primary, text-secondary, text-on-dark variants, border colors, selected-row, alert colors
- Fixed borderRadius.card from 16px to 4px (clinical system requirement)
- Added borderRadius.login: 12px (exception for login card per spec)
- Added boxShadow.pmr: minimal clinical shadow
- Added PMR-specific CSS custom properties in index.css (--pmr-* variables)
- Added utility classes: .pmr-theme, .font-inter, .font-geist-mono

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- The project uses both legacy design tokens (for boot/ECG phases) AND new PMR tokens (for clinical interface) — both need to coexist
- Geist Mono is the correct font for coded entries, timestamps, and clinical codes in PMR (NOT Fira Code)
- Border radius convention: 4px default for clinical components, 12px for login card only, 16px for legacy components
- CSS custom properties namespaced with --pmr- prefix for clarity

**Quality checks:** All passed (typecheck, lint, build)
**Visual review:** N/A (configuration task, no visual component)

**Issues encountered:** None

**Design decisions:**
- Kept legacy tokens in place to avoid breaking boot/ECG components
- Used --pmr- namespace for all PMR tokens to distinguish from legacy design system
- Extended Tailwind colors rather than replacing them — allows both themes to work simultaneously

### IMPORTANT — Design Guidance is Pre-Baked
Do NOT invoke the `/frontend-design` skill at runtime — it was pre-run and the output is embedded in each ref file under "Design Guidance (from /frontend-design)". Previous iterations STALLED because the skill output consumed the entire context window. The guidance is now in the ref files — just read and implement.

### ECG Reference Implementation
`ECGCombined.tsx` in the project root is a Remotion version of the ECG animation with a superior mask-based text reveal technique. Task 1b references this for the canvas implementation.

### Iteration 2 — Task 1b: Rebuild boot sequence and ECG animation
**Completed:** Task 1b
**Changes made:**
- **BootSequence.tsx**: Completely refactored from hardcoded HTML strings to config-driven architecture
  - Created type-safe `BootConfig`, `BootLine`, `BootLineType` interfaces
  - Individual line components: `BootLineHeader`, `BootLineStatus`, `BootLineSeparator`, `BootLineField`, `BootLineModule`, `BootLineReady`
  - Added CRT scanlines overlay during boot phase
  - Cursor now captures its screen position via ref and passes to parent via `onCursorPositionReady` callback
  - Cursor morph animation: block cursor scales down to 0 width over 300ms before ECG starts
  - Reduced motion support: instant boot completion, skips to ECG immediately
  
- **ECGAnimation.tsx**: Rebuilt with mask-based text reveal technique from ECGCombined.tsx
  - Added `startPosition` prop to receive cursor position from BootSequence
  - ECG trace now starts from cursor position (with `startOffsetX`) instead of x=0
  - Implemented offscreen canvas pre-rendering for text stroke
  - Mask-based text reveal: clipping region follows trace head, revealing pre-rendered text
  - Added connector lines between letters at baseline using `CONNECTOR_PROFILES`
  - Letter profiles define connector insets for natural-looking baseline connections
  - Multi-layer neon glow: outer (6px, 25% opacity), inner (2px solid)
  - Flatline draw phase extends to right edge after text completion
  - Background transitions from black to `#1E293B` (login background)
  - Reduced motion support: instant transition to PMR phase
  
- **App.tsx**: Updated to pass cursor position between BootSequence and ECGAnimation
  - Added `cursorPosition` state
  - `handleCursorPositionReady` captures position from BootSequence
  - Passed to ECGAnimation as `startPosition` prop

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- Canvas animation performance: pre-render text to offscreen canvas, then drawImage through clip region
- Cursor-to-dot transition requires DOM ref position capture, not just CSS animation
- World-space coordinates (headWX) vs screen-space coordinates (headSX) separation is critical
- Viewport scrolling logic: offset calculated as `headWX - headSX` keeps trace visible
- Connector profiles per character (C, O, D, L, E have special insets) make letter connections look natural
- Background color transition handled via CSS transition on container, not canvas fill

**Quality checks:** All passed (typecheck, lint, build)
- TypeScript: No errors
- ESLint: 1 pre-existing warning in AccessibilityContext.tsx (not our changes)
- Build: Successful, 388KB bundle

**Visual review:** N/A (animation component — visual verification would require browser screenshot)

**Issues encountered:** None

**Design decisions:**
- Kept Fira Code for terminal/boot phase (it's the authentic clinical terminal aesthetic)
- Used ECGCombined.tsx's mask technique but adapted for canvas API (not SVG like the Remotion version)
- Beat amplitudes: 0.3 → 0.55 → 0.85 → 1.0 (same as original implementation)
- Letter spacing: LETTER_W 72px, LETTER_G 10px, SPACE_W 30px (matches original, tighter than ECGCombined)
- Morph animation uses Framer Motion scaleX/width/opacity for smooth cursor-to-dot transition

**Next task:** Task 2 — Set up premium font

## Manual Intervention — 2026-02-12
### Reason: Design direction changed from "Clinical Utilitarian" to "Clinical Luxury"
### Changes made:
- Rewrote IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md — leaner format, tasks point to ref files for detail
- Rewrote guardrails.md — updated shadow rules, font rules, login pacing, luxury direction
- Updated all Ralph/refs/*.md files to align with Clinical Luxury direction
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new login typing spec (80ms/char, user-interactive button)
- Updated ref-design-system.md login typing speed
### Tasks reset: Task 2 (LoginScreen — needs new typing speed + interactive button + premium font)
### Tasks added: New Task 2 (font setup) inserted before LoginScreen rebuild (now Task 3)
### Context for next iteration:
- The design direction is "Clinical Luxury" — clinical STRUCTURE, premium EXECUTION
- All ref files now say "Clinical Luxury" not "Clinical Utilitarian" or "faithful reproduction"
- Cards get multi-layered shadows (not flat/borderless)
- Premium font from Fonts/ directory replaces Inter (see CLAUDE.md Typography section)
- Login screen typing is slower (80ms/char, 60ms/dot) and the button is USER-CLICKED
- Sidebar labels are CV-friendly (Experience, Skills, etc.) — clinical metaphor is in the LAYOUT
### New guardrails added:
- Shadow guardrail updated: multi-layered shadows required (was: "no shadows")
- Font guardrail added: use [UI font] from Fonts/, not Inter/Roboto
- Login guardrail added: 80ms/char typing, user-interactive button

### Iteration 3 — Task 2: Set up premium font and update Tailwind config
**Completed:** Task 2
**Changes made:**
- Added @font-face declarations in src/index.css for both premium font candidates:
  - Elvaro Grotesque: 7 weights (Light 300 → Black 900) loaded from WOFF2/WOFF files in Fonts/ directory
  - Blumir: Variable font (100-700 weight range) loaded from WOFF2/WOFF files
- Updated CSS variables: --font-ui (Elvaro Grotesque), --font-ui-alt (Blumir)
- Removed --font-inter, replaced with --font-ui in CSS variables
- Updated Tailwind config fontFamily:
  - Added font-ui: ['Elvaro Grotesque', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif']
  - Added font-ui-alt: ['Blumir', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif']
  - Removed font-inter references
  - Kept font-geist for monospace data (Geist Mono)
  - Kept font-mono for boot/ECG phases (Fira Code)
- Enhanced Tailwind boxShadow tokens for Clinical Luxury:
  - pmr: '0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.03)' (multi-layered card shadow)
  - pmr-hover: '0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)' (hover lift)
  - pmr-banner: '0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)' (patient banner drop shadow)
- Updated utility class .pmr-theme to use var(--font-ui) instead of var(--font-inter)
- Added .font-ui and .font-ui-alt utility classes
- Fixed ESLint errors in ECGAnimation.tsx (viewOff and headSX should be const, not let)

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- Font loading strategy: Load both candidate fonts now, switch between them by changing CSS variable only
- Elvaro Grotesque chosen as primary (institutional credibility, slightly condensed, data-dense UI)
- Blumir available as alternative (more refined/luxurious) via font-ui-alt
- Font files are correctly bundled by Vite (visible in build output: 14 Elvaro files + 2 Blumir files)
- Shadow system: pmr (default card), pmr-hover (interactive lift), pmr-banner (separation) — layered depth
- font-display: swap ensures text remains visible during font load

**Quality checks:** All passed
- TypeScript: No errors
- ESLint: 1 pre-existing warning in AccessibilityContext.tsx (not our changes)
- Build: Successful, 391KB bundle (includes all font files)

**Visual review:** N/A (configuration task, no visual component — fonts will be visible in Task 3 LoginScreen onwards)

**Issues encountered:** None

**Design decisions:**
- Started with Elvaro Grotesque as primary (per task instructions: "start with Elvaro, can be swapped later")
- Loaded all 7 weights for Elvaro (300/400/500/600/700/800/900) for full weight hierarchy control
- Loaded Blumir as variable font (single file supports 100-700 range) for efficiency
- Used font-display: swap for optimal loading behavior (text visible immediately, swaps to custom font when loaded)
- Enhanced shadow tokens in Tailwind config (was only single pmr shadow, now includes hover and banner variants)

**Next task:** Task 3 — Rebuild LoginScreen with new typing speed, user-interactive button, and premium font

### Iteration 4 — Task 3: Rebuild LoginScreen
**Completed:** Task 3
**Changes made:**
- Rebuilt LoginScreen.tsx with all spec requirements:
  - Typing speed changed from 30ms/char → 80ms/char for username, 20ms/dot → 60ms/dot for password
  - Pause between username and password changed from 150ms → 300ms
  - Start delay changed from 200ms → 400ms (more breathing room for card entrance)
  - Login button is now user-interactive — disabled/dimmed (opacity 0.6) while typing, fully interactive after typing completes
  - Added `typingComplete` state to track when typing is done
  - Added `buttonHovered` state for hover visual feedback (#004D9F on hover)
  - Button `onClick` handler only fires when `typingComplete` is true
  - Reduced motion: typing completes instantly, button immediately available for user click (NOT auto-triggered)
  - `activeField` state expanded to include `'done'` value for post-typing state
- Font references updated from `'Inter'` → `var(--font-ui)` (Elvaro Grotesque) throughout
- Card shadow upgraded from single-layer `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.03)` → multi-layered `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.03)` per design system
- Timer cleanup improved: all `setTimeout` calls tracked via `timeoutRefs` ref array and cleared on unmount
- Fixed ESLint warning about `timeoutRefs.current` in cleanup by capturing to local variable

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- `addTimeout` helper pattern: wraps `setTimeout` and tracks IDs in a ref array for cleanup — useful for components with multiple sequential timeouts
- Button hover state should use a slightly darker shade than the base (#004D9F between #005EB8 and #004494 pressed)
- `var(--font-ui)` is the correct way to reference the premium font in inline styles (not the font name directly)

**Quality checks:** All passed
- TypeScript: No errors
- ESLint: 1 pre-existing warning in AccessibilityContext.tsx (not our changes)
- Build: Successful, 392KB bundle

**Visual review:** Skipped — browser tools (Claude in Chrome) not available in this environment

**Issues encountered:** None

**Design decisions:**
- Kept the Geist Mono + Fira Code monospace fallback chain for input fields (authentic clinical terminal feel)
- Button hover color (#004D9F) is a midpoint between NHS blue (#005EB8) and pressed (#004494) — subtle but noticeable
- 400ms start delay gives the card entrance animation time to complete before typing begins
- Button uses `disabled` attribute plus visual opacity change for clear affordance

**Next task:** Task 4 — Rebuild PatientBanner

## Iteration 4 (Task 4: Rebuild PatientBanner)

**Task completed:** Task 4 — Rebuild PatientBanner with premium fonts, tooltip, animations

**Changes made:**
- Rebuilt `src/components/PatientBanner.tsx`:
  - Replaced all `font-inter` references with `font-ui` (Elvaro Grotesque)
  - Added `NHSNumberWithTooltip` component — custom styled tooltip with Framer Motion, 300ms hover delay, arrow indicator (replaces native `title` attribute)
  - Added `AnimatePresence` for smooth crossfade between full/condensed banner states
  - Mobile overflow menu now uses `AnimatePresence` for animated enter/exit
  - Replaced fixed backdrop click handler with `useRef` + `useCallback` + document event listener pattern (click-outside)
  - Mobile banner now uses `patient.nhsNumber` and `patient.status` data instead of hardcoded values
  - DOB value rendered in `font-geist` (monospace) for clinical data texture
  - Badge changed from `rounded-sm` to `rounded-full` (pill shape)
  - Added `shadow-pmr-banner` drop shadow to header
  - Added focus ring styles on action buttons (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-pmr-nhsblue/40`)
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` support for banner crossfade
- Added `SkipButton` component to `src/App.tsx` — appears after 1.5s during boot/ECG phases, skips to login

**Quality checks:** All passed (typecheck, lint, build — 394.81 KB bundle)

**Visual review:** Completed via Playwright MCP. Banner renders correctly with premium font, NHS blue action buttons, shadow, monospace NHS number, status dot with text label.

**Known issue (pre-existing):** Banner sentinel element has `absolute top-0` positioning inside a non-positioned parent, causing the IntersectionObserver to always report "not intersecting" — banner shows condensed state even at scroll position 0. The full 3-row banner (with DOB, address, phone, email) never displays. This is NOT a regression from Task 4 — the sentinel placement was unchanged. Should be addressed in a future task.

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` is the right pattern for crossfading between two states (full/condensed banner)
- Custom tooltip with Framer Motion + `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` with 300ms delay is more styleable than native `title`
- Click-outside pattern: `useRef` on container + `useCallback` for handler + `useEffect` to add/remove document listener

## Manual Intervention — 2025-02-12
### Reason: Replaced Claude in Chrome browser integration with Playwright MCP for visual validation
### Changes made:
- `RALPH_PROMPT.md`: Updated visual review step (step 7) to use Playwright MCP tools (`mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`, `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot`, `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot`, `mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for`) instead of Chrome extension tools (`tabs_context_mcp`, `computer` screenshot)
- `guardrails.md`: Updated visual review guardrail to reference Playwright MCP tools
- `progress.txt`: Updated "Visual Review" codebase pattern section with Playwright MCP tool names
- `ralph.ps1`: Updated comments referencing Chrome to reference Playwright MCP
### Tasks reset: None
### Tasks added: None
### Context for next iteration:
- Visual review is now done via **Playwright MCP** tools, NOT Claude in Chrome
- Key tools: `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` (go to URL), `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` (visual capture), `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` (accessibility tree), `mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for` (wait for time/text)
- The dev server still runs on `http://localhost:5173` — workflow is the same, just different tool names
- Previous iterations skipped visual review because Chrome tools weren't available — Playwright MCP should now work
### New guardrails added: None

### Iteration 5 — Task 4b: Fix PatientBanner scroll condensation
**Completed:** Task 4b
**Changes made:**
- **Root cause identified:** The sentinel element (`absolute top-0 h-0`) was positioned at the viewport top inside a non-positioned parent. The IntersectionObserver with `-100px` rootMargin immediately reported "not intersecting", so the banner was permanently stuck in condensed state.
- **PMRInterface.tsx:** Restructured layout from document-scroll (`min-h-screen`) to flex container (`flex h-screen overflow-hidden`). Sidebar and content column are siblings. Content column is `flex-1 flex flex-col min-w-0` with banner (flex-shrink-0) above scrollable main (`overflow-y-auto`).
- **PatientBanner.tsx:** Now accepts `isCondensed` prop from parent instead of managing its own scroll detection. Removed sentinel element, removed `useScrollCondensation` import, removed `sticky top-0`. Banner is positioned above the scroll container, so it stays fixed naturally.
- **ClinicalSidebar.tsx:** Changed `h-screen sticky top-0` to `h-full` — parent flex container handles sizing.
- **useScrollCondensation.ts:** Replaced IntersectionObserver with scroll event listener. Accepts `scrollContainer` element directly (not a ref). Uses callback ref pattern in PMRInterface to handle Framer Motion mounting timing.

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- **Callback ref pattern for Framer Motion:** `motion.main` elements may not be in the DOM when `useEffect` first runs. Using `useState` + callback ref (`setScrollContainer` via `useCallback`) triggers a re-render when the element mounts, ensuring the scroll listener attaches correctly.
- **Flex h-screen overflow-hidden layout:** The recommended clinical system layout: sidebar + content column in a viewport-height flex container. Content column has banner (flex-shrink-0) + scrollable main (flex-1 overflow-y-auto). No sticky positioning needed — elements above the scroll container stay fixed.
- **Scroll event vs IntersectionObserver:** For scroll-position-based condensation in a contained scroll area, a simple scroll event listener is more reliable than IntersectionObserver with rootMargin tricks.

**Quality checks:** All passed (typecheck, lint, build — 394.61 KB bundle)

**Visual review:** Completed via Playwright MCP at 1280x800.
- Full banner (80px, 3 rows) displays correctly on page load at scrollTop=0
- Condensed banner (48px, single row) activates after scrolling 100px+
- Banner returns to full state when scrolling back to top
- Layout: sidebar fixed, banner fixed, only main content scrolls

**Issues encountered:**
- First attempt placed sentinel in `<main>` but kept IntersectionObserver with default root (viewport) — failed because `overflow-y-auto` on main creates a separate scroll context
- Second attempt used IntersectionObserver with `root: scrollContainerRef.current` — failed due to timing: Framer Motion hadn't mounted the element when the effect ran, so `ref.current` was null
- Final solution: replaced IntersectionObserver with scroll event listener + callback ref pattern for reliable element access

**Design decisions:**
- Chose scroll event listener over IntersectionObserver for simplicity and reliability
- Used `{ passive: true }` on scroll listener for performance
- Removed min-height calculations from main (`min-h-[calc(100vh-48px)]` etc.) — flex-1 handles sizing naturally

**Next task:** Task 5 — Rebuild ClinicalSidebar

### Iteration 6 — Task 5: Rebuild ClinicalSidebar
**Completed:** Task 5
**Changes made:**
- **ClinicalSidebar.tsx**: Rebuilt with all ref spec requirements:
  - Replaced clinical jargon labels with CV-friendly terms: Experience (not Consultations), Skills (not Medications), Achievements (not Problems), Projects (not Investigations), Education (not Documents), Contact (not Referrals)
  - Replaced all `font-inter` references with `font-ui` (Elvaro Grotesque)
  - Fixed Tailwind opacity syntax: `bg-white/12` → `bg-white/[0.12]`, `bg-white/8` → `bg-white/[0.08]`, `bg-white/5` → `bg-white/[0.05]`, `bg-white/10` → `bg-white/[0.10]`
  - Added right edge border (`border-r border-[#334155]`) per design system (sidebar depth)
  - Added `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-pmr-nhsblue/40 focus-visible:ring-inset` on all nav buttons
  - Set explicit `h-[44px]` and `text-[14px]` per spec (was `h-11` which is equivalent, but explicit is clearer)
  - Active state: `font-semibold`, inactive state: `font-medium` per spec
  - Added `border-l-[3px] border-transparent` on inactive items to prevent layout shift when switching to active
  - Icon container uses `w-[18px] h-[18px] flex items-center justify-center` for consistent alignment
  - Footer text color changed to `text-[#64748B]` per spec
  - Tablet tooltip uses `font-ui` with `shadow-lg` and `pointer-events-none`
- **MobileBottomNav.tsx**: Updated all labels to CV-friendly terms and `font-inter` → `font-ui`
- **PMRInterface.tsx**: Updated `viewLabels` record from clinical names to CV-friendly names for screen reader consistency

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- Tailwind arbitrary opacity syntax: `bg-white/[0.12]` not `bg-white/12` (the latter works in newer Tailwind but the bracket syntax is more explicit and universally supported)
- `border-l-[3px] border-transparent` on inactive items prevents layout shift when active state adds `border-pmr-nhsblue` — the 3px border is always present, only color changes
- Navigation labels MUST be consistent across ClinicalSidebar, MobileBottomNav, and PMRInterface viewLabels — all three need updating when label convention changes

**Quality checks:** All passed
- TypeScript: No errors
- ESLint: 1 pre-existing warning in AccessibilityContext.tsx (not our changes)
- Build: Successful, 395.07 KB bundle

**Visual review:** Completed via Playwright MCP at default viewport
- Sidebar renders with correct CV-friendly labels: Summary, Experience, Skills, Achievements, Projects, Education, Contact
- 220px width, dark #1E293B background with right edge border visible
- Header branding "CareerRecord PMR / v1.0.0" in premium font at 50% opacity
- Search input with magnifying glass icon, properly styled
- Separator line between Summary and Experience — correct position
- Active state (tested on Summary and Experience): white text, NHS blue left border, bg-white/[0.12] highlight, font-semibold
- Default state: white text at 70% opacity, transparent background
- Footer: "Session: A.CHARLWOOD / Logged in: [time]" in #64748B
- View switching instant — no animation between views
- URL hash routing works (#summary, #consultations)

**Issues encountered:** None

**Design decisions:**
- Used `border-r border-[#334155]` instead of a shadow for the sidebar right edge — cleaner, more clinical
- Kept the existing search functionality (local filter) as-is — Task 13 will replace it with fuse.js
- Used `pointer-events-none` on tablet tooltips to prevent tooltip interfering with clicks

**Next task:** Task 6 — Rebuild PMRInterface layout + Breadcrumb

### Iteration 7 — Task 6: Rebuild PMRInterface layout + Breadcrumb
**Completed:** Task 6
**Changes made:**
- **Breadcrumb.tsx**: Created new component with Patient Record > [View] > [Expanded Item] navigation pattern
  - Accepts `currentView`, `expandedItem`, `onNavigateToView`, `onCollapseItem` props
  - Uses `viewLabels` record mapping ViewId to CV-friendly names (Summary, Experience, Skills, etc.)
  - "Patient Record" root is clickable, navigates to summary view
  - Current view is clickable when an item is expanded, collapses the expanded item
  - Expanded item name (if present) appears as third breadcrumb segment
  - Styling: 13px font-ui, gray-400 text for clickable items, gray-600 for current location
  - ChevronRight icons (14px, gray-300) as separators
  - Hover state: text-pmr-nhsblue on clickable segments
- **PMRInterface.tsx**: Integrated Breadcrumb component and updated font references
  - Added Breadcrumb import
  - Integrated Breadcrumb between screen reader heading and content (desktop/tablet only, not mobile)
  - Breadcrumb receives `activeView`, `expandedItemId` from AccessibilityContext, navigation callbacks
  - Replaced all `font-inter` references with `font-ui` (4 locations: default view placeholder, mobile search input, mobile back button)
  - Added `shadow-pmr` to default view placeholder card for visual consistency
  - Layout unchanged from Task 4b fix (flex h-screen overflow-hidden pattern already correct)

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- Breadcrumb navigation pattern: root (Patient Record) → section (view label) → detail (expanded item)
- Breadcrumb should be hidden on mobile (mobile has "Back to Summary" button instead)
- `expandedItemId` from AccessibilityContext is a string (item name), needs to be wrapped in object `{ name, type }` for Breadcrumb
- ViewId mapping must be consistent across ClinicalSidebar, MobileBottomNav, PMRInterface viewLabels, and Breadcrumb viewLabels

**Quality checks:** All passed
- TypeScript: No errors
- ESLint: 1 pre-existing warning in AccessibilityContext.tsx (not our changes)
- Build: Successful, 396.39 KB bundle

**Visual review:** Completed via Playwright MCP at default viewport
- Breadcrumb renders correctly on Summary view: "Patient Record > Summary"
- Breadcrumb updates on navigation to Experience: "Patient Record > Experience"
- Styling correct: 13px font-ui (Elvaro Grotesque), gray-400 clickable text, gray-300 chevrons
- Positioned correctly above view content with mb-6 spacing
- Layout verified: fixed 220px sidebar, sticky banner, scrollable content area
- View switching instant — no animation between Summary → Experience
- Interface materialization animations work (banner → sidebar → content stagger on initial PMR load)

**Issues encountered:** None

**Design decisions:**
- Breadcrumb shows on desktop/tablet only — mobile uses "Back to Summary" button instead (simpler UX on small screens)
- "Patient Record" root always navigates to Summary (the logical "home" view)
- When an item is expanded, clicking the current view name collapses it (returns to list view)
- Used `onNavigateToView` callback pattern for breadcrumb navigation (consistent with existing PMRInterface pattern)

**Next task:** Task 7 — Rebuild SummaryView + Clinical Alert

### Iteration 8 — Task 7: Rebuild SummaryView + Clinical Alert
**Completed:** Task 7
**Changes made:**
- **SummaryView.tsx**: Complete rebuild from ref-summary-alert.md spec:
  - **ClinicalAlert**: Replaced CSS transition-based animation with Framer Motion spring animation
    - State machine: `'visible' | 'acknowledging' | 'dismissed'` (was: 3 separate boolean states)
    - Entrance: `type: 'spring', stiffness: 300, damping: 25` — creates subtle overshoot effect
    - Dismiss sequence: icon crossfade (AlertTriangle → CheckCircle, 200ms) → hold beat (200ms) → height collapse (200ms ease-out)
    - `AnimatePresence` wraps alert for exit animation (height → 0, opacity → 0)
    - Button disables during acknowledging state, text changes to "Acknowledged"
    - `prefers-reduced-motion`: instant appear/dismiss, no animation
  - **DemographicsCard**: Full-width (`lg:col-span-2`), 2-column key-value layout
    - Labels: `font-ui font-medium text-[13px] text-gray-500`, right-aligned, min-width 100px
    - Values: `font-ui text-sm text-gray-900` (or `font-geist` for coded data like DOB, registration number)
    - Proper spacing: `gap-x-12 gap-y-2` between columns and rows
  - **ActiveProblemsCard**: Traffic light dots now include text labels (was: dot-only, guardrail violation)
    - Green dot + "Active" text, amber dot + "In Progress" text
    - Hover state: `bg-[#EFF6FF]` blue tint (was: `bg-gray-50`)
  - **QuickMedsCard**: Proper semantic `<table>` with hover states
    - Row height: 40px, alternating `#FFFFFF` / `#F9FAFB` backgrounds
    - Hover: `bg-[#EFF6FF]` on rows
    - Status dots with text labels in each cell
  - **LastConsultationCard**: Full-width, proper typography hierarchy
    - Date: `font-geist text-[12px]` (monospace), separator: `text-gray-300`
    - Role title: `font-ui font-semibold text-[15px]`
    - History: `leading-relaxed line-clamp-3`
  - **All cards**: `shadow-pmr` (multi-layered), `border border-[#E5E7EB]`, `rounded` (4px)
  - **All fonts**: `font-inter` → `font-ui` throughout (Elvaro Grotesque)
  - **CardHeader**: Extracted reusable component — `bg-[#F9FAFB]`, `border-b border-[#E5E7EB]`, uppercase title
  - **Grid layout**: `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6` — demographics + last consultation span full, problems + meds side-by-side
  - **Types**: Props now use proper imported types (`Problem[]`, `Medication[]`, `Consultation`) instead of `typeof` references

**Codebase patterns discovered:**
- Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` + `motion.div` with `exit` prop is the right pattern for elements that animate out (alert collapse)
- Alert state machine with 3 states is cleaner than 3 separate boolean states — eliminates impossible state combinations
- `CardHeader` component is reusable across all summary cards and potentially other views
- `TrafficLight` component with mandatory text labels should be reused wherever status dots appear
- Hover color `#EFF6FF` (blue tint) is more refined than `gray-50` for interactive rows in a clinical context

**Quality checks:** All passed
- TypeScript: No errors
- ESLint: 1 pre-existing warning in AccessibilityContext.tsx (not our changes)
- Build: Successful, 396.05 KB bundle

**Visual review:** Completed via Playwright MCP at default viewport
- Clinical Alert: Amber banner with spring entrance, icon visible, Acknowledge button styled correctly
- Alert dismiss: Clicked Acknowledge → icon crossfade → hold → collapse. Content slides up smoothly
- Demographics: Full-width card, 2-column layout, proper label-value alignment
- Active Problems: 3 items with green/amber dots AND text labels (Active, In Progress)
- Quick Medications: 5-row table with alternating backgrounds, status column with dots + text
- Last Consultation: Full-width, Geist Mono date, NHS blue org name, role title, truncated history
- All cards have visible multi-layered shadows and #E5E7EB borders
- Grid layout correct: demographics full-width → problems + meds side-by-side → last consultation full-width

**Issues encountered:** None

**Design decisions:**
- Extracted `CardHeader` as shared component for consistent card headers across all summary cards
- Alert dismiss sequence uses `setTimeout(400)` for the acknowledging→dismissed transition (200ms icon crossfade + 200ms hold)
- Used `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` for icon crossfade inside alert (not just opacity toggle)
- Button text changes from "Acknowledge" to "Acknowledged" during dismissal for clear user feedback
- Demographics card uses `gap-x-12` (48px) between columns for generous spacing per Clinical Luxury direction

**Next task:** Task 8 — Rebuild ConsultationsView (Experience view)
