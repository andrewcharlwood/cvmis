# Progress Log — React Conversion Phase

## Codebase Patterns
- **Source of truth**: `References/concept.html` contains the complete working HTML implementation. All animations, timing, colors, and styling must be preserved exactly when porting to React.
- **Tech stack**: React 18+, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React
- **Project structure**: Components in `src/components/`, hooks in `src/hooks/`, types in `src/types/`, utilities in `src/lib/`
- **Animation approach**: Framer Motion for complex sequences (boot, ECG), CSS transitions for simple hover effects, IntersectionObserver (via hook) for scroll-triggered animations
- **SVG animations**: Use Framer Motion's `pathLength` prop for drawing effects, or CSS `stroke-dasharray`/`stroke-dashoffset` for skill gauges
- **Skill gauge math**: `circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius`, `strokeDashoffset = circumference * (1 - level / 100)`, rotate -90deg to start from top
- **Boot sequence timing**: 14 lines × 220ms = ~3080ms, plus 400ms pause, 800ms fade = ~4.28s total
- **ECG timing**: Flatline 1000ms + 3 beats × 600ms + holds 300ms + branching 1500ms + fade 500ms = ~5.5s
- **Color palette**: 
  - ECG phase: #000 (black), #00ff41 (green), #00e5ff (cyan), #3a6b45 (dim green)
  - Final design: #00897B (teal), #FF6B6B (coral), #0F172A (heading), #334155 (text), #94A3B8 (muted)
- **Fonts**: Fira Code (boot), Plus Jakarta Sans (primary), Inter Tight (secondary)
- **Responsive breakpoints**: 768px (tablet), 480px (mobile)

## Iteration Log

### Phase Transition — React Conversion Setup
- Previous phase completed: Single HTML file `concept.html` fully built with all 9 tasks
- New phase started: Convert HTML concept to React + TypeScript + Vite project
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md updated with 12 React-specific tasks
- RALPH_PROMPT.md updated with explicit /frontend-design skill requirement for all visual components
- This progress.txt reset for new phase

<!-- Iterations will be logged here as tasks are completed -->
